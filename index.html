    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english/gucci_fashion target="blank">GucciFashion</a>It's quite certain that when Guccio Gucci started out, he never dreamed that his small luggage company would grow to one carrying such cultural significance.<br> But since Gucci was founded in Florence in 1921, the company has built a catalog of genuinely iconic trademarks.<br> The interlocking GG logo; the bar-and-bit belt buckle; the bamboo-handle handbag; the omnipresent loaferâ€”all of them have helped the brand penetrate mainstream culture like no other Italian label in history</p>

    <p>The groundwork for the company's epic expansion was laid under the leadership of Guccio's eldest son, Aldo.<br> A flamboyant businessman, he transformed the business into the accessories destination of choice for Europe's emerging jet set.<br> By the end of the 1960s, everyone from Queen Elizabeth II to Elizabeth Taylor was a patron.</p>
    <h2>Dress Code</h2>

    <p>In keeping with the father-son tradition, Aldo's son Paolo ushered in Gucci's next great era, in the late 1960s, with the introduction of clothing.<br> By the early 70s, the lean silhouettes, fur-lined coats, and shiny satin lapels we think of today as Gucci hallmarks began to appear.</p>
